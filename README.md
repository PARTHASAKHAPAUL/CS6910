DEEP_LEARNING:::
In this assignment I need to implement a feedforward neural network and write the backpropagation code for training the network the Fashion-MNIST dataset by using numpy for all matrix/vector operations,without any automatic differentiation packages. This network will be trained and tested using the Fashion-MNIST dataset. Specifically, given an input image (28 x 28 = 784 pixels) from the Fashion-MNIST dataset, the network will be trained to classify the image into 1 of 10 classes.
